The National Salt Reduction Initiative (NSRI) is a U.S.-based coalition initiated in 2009 aimed at ‚Äúreducing population sodium intake by 20%, through a reduction in sodium in US packaged and restaurant foods by 25% by 2014‚Äù. The NSRI set target levels in 61 packaged food categories for 2012 and 2014. ‚ÄúIn 2009, when the targets were established, no categories met NSRI 2012 or 2014 targets. In 2014, 16 (26%) categories met 2012 targets and 2 (3%) met 2014 targets.‚Äù By 2014, 45% of food products had achieved the 2012 targets. From 2009 to 2014, the sales-weighted mean sodium density declined significantly by 6.8%, with reductions seen in 43% of food categories. No change was reported in restaurant food.2. The initial phase of this effort, the National Salt Reduction Initiative, tracked nation-wide progress of sodium reduction in packaged and restaurant foods. Between 2009 and 2014, there was a 6.8% reduction in sodium levels in the U.S. food supply. -https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/national-salt-sugar-reduction-initiative.page",,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,manual,the National Salt Reduction Initiative (NSRI).
